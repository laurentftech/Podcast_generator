## üí° Examples

### Creating multi-voice podcasts from written scripts

```txt
John: Hello everyone, welcome to this new episode.
Samantha: Today, we will explore the basics of artificial intelligence.
John: Stay with us to learn more!
Samantha: Don't forget to subscribe to our podcast.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The speaker names in your script (e.g., John:, Samantha:) must **exactly** match the names defined in the "Voice Settings" window. If not, the script will not be processed.

### Here's an example of a script with emotional tone instructions:

```txt 
Read aloud the play with emphasing strongly the emotions of the characters.
Cyrano: [mocking] Ah ! non ! c‚Äôest un peu court, jeune homme !
On pouvait dire‚Ä¶ oh ! Dieu ! ‚Ä¶ bien des choses en somme‚Ä¶
[sarcastic] Agressif : ¬´ moi, monsieur, si j‚Äôavais un tel nez,
Il faudrait sur-le-champ que je me l‚Äôamputasse ! ¬ª
[playful] Amical : ¬´ Mais il doit tremper dans votre tasse !
Pour boire, faites-vous fabriquer un hanap ! ¬ª
[dramatic] Descriptif : ¬´ C‚Äôest un roc ! ‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest un pic ! ‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest un cap !
Que dis-je, c‚Äôest un cap ? ‚Ä¶ C‚Äôest une p√©ninsule ! ¬ª
[teasing] Curieux : ¬´ De quoi sert cette oblongue capsule ?
D‚Äô√©critoire, monsieur, ou de bo√Æte √† ciseaux ? ¬ª
```

üí° Note on Annotations: The app uses square brackets [emotion] for ElevenLabs' emotional cues. If you use Gemini, the app will automatically convert them to parentheses (emotion) for you.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Required Dependency: FFmpeg

For audio conversion and playback, this application requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system.

#### **macOS**
Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### **Linux**
Most distributions provide FFmpeg in their package manager:
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg        # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ffmpeg        # Fedora
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg          # Arch
```

#### **Windows (Detailed Guide)**

1. **Download FFmpeg**  
   Go to the official FFmpeg build page:  
   üëâ [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)  
   Download the latest **"release full"** ZIP archive (e.g., `ffmpeg-release-full.7z` or `.zip`).

2. **Extract the archive**  
   - Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and choose **Extract All‚Ä¶**  
   - You will get a folder named similar to `ffmpeg-2025-xx-xx-full_build`.

3. **Move the folder**  
   - Move the extracted `ffmpeg` folder to a location where it will stay permanently, for example:  
     `C:\ffmpeg`

4. **Add FFmpeg to the PATH**  
   - Press **Windows + R**, type:
     ```
     sysdm.cpl
     ```
     and press **Enter**.
   - In the **System Properties** window, go to **Advanced** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System variables**, find and select **Path**, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the path to FFmpeg‚Äôs `bin` folder, e.g.:
     ```
     C:\ffmpeg\bin
     ```
   - Click **OK** to close all dialogs.

5. **Verify installation**  
   - Open **Command Prompt** and type:
     ```
     ffmpeg -version
     ```
     You should see the version info, confirming FFmpeg is installed and accessible from anywhere.
