## üìñ Overview
A lightweight Python app with a modern UI that lets you generate multi-speaker podcasts from any script. It uses high-quality voices from the **ElevenLabs** and **Google Gemini** APIs, and can even create synchronized HTML demos of your podcasts.


### üîë Getting Started
Get your free API key from [ElevenLabs](https://try.elevenlabs.io/zobct2wsp98z) (or Google Gemini).
Add it securely to the app.
Start creating your own podcasts in minutes.

üí° **Note**: I am an **affiliate of ElevenLabs**. Using this link may earn me a commission at no extra cost to you. ElevenLabs also offers a **free tier** with monthly character limits for premium voices.

## üí° Examples

### Creating multi-voice podcasts from written scripts

```txt
John: Hello everyone, welcome to this new episode.
Samantha: Today, we will explore the basics of artificial intelligence.
John: Stay with us to learn more!
Samantha: Don't forget to subscribe to our podcast.
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The speaker names in your script (e.g., John:, Samantha:) must **exactly** match the names defined in the "Voice Settings" window. If not, the script will not be processed.

### Here's an example of a script with emotional tone instructions:

```txt 
Read aloud the play with emphasing strongly the emotions of the characters.
Cyrano: [mocking] Ah ! non ! c‚Äôest un peu court, jeune homme !
On pouvait dire‚Ä¶ oh ! Dieu ! ‚Ä¶ bien des choses en somme‚Ä¶
[sarcastic] Agressif : ¬´ moi, monsieur, si j‚Äôavais un tel nez,
Il faudrait sur-le-champ que je me l‚Äôamputasse ! ¬ª
[playful] Amical : ¬´ Mais il doit tremper dans votre tasse !
Pour boire, faites-vous fabriquer un hanap ! ¬ª
[dramatic] Descriptif : ¬´ C‚Äôest un roc ! ‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest un pic ! ‚Ä¶ c‚Äôest un cap !
Que dis-je, c‚Äôest un cap ? ‚Ä¶ C‚Äôest une p√©ninsule ! ¬ª
[teasing] Curieux : ¬´ De quoi sert cette oblongue capsule ?
D‚Äô√©critoire, monsieur, ou de bo√Æte √† ciseaux ? ¬ª
```

üí° Note on Annotations: The app uses square brackets [emotion] for ElevenLabs' emotional cues. If you use Gemini, the app will automatically convert them to parentheses (emotion) for you.

## üì¶ Installation

### 1. Required Dependency: FFmpeg

For audio conversion and playback, this application requires FFmpeg to be installed on your system.

#### **macOS**
Install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

#### **Linux**
Most distributions provide FFmpeg in their package manager:
```bash
sudo apt install ffmpeg        # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo dnf install ffmpeg        # Fedora
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg          # Arch
```

#### **Windows (Detailed Guide)**

1. **Download FFmpeg**  
   Go to the official FFmpeg build page:  
   üëâ [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)  
   Download the latest **"release full"** ZIP archive (e.g., `ffmpeg-release-full.7z` or `.zip`).

2. **Extract the archive**  
   - Right-click the downloaded ZIP file and choose **Extract All‚Ä¶**  
   - You will get a folder named similar to `ffmpeg-2025-xx-xx-full_build`.

3. **Move the folder**  
   - Move the extracted `ffmpeg` folder to a location where it will stay permanently, for example:  
     `C:\ffmpeg`

4. **Add FFmpeg to the PATH**  
   - Press **Windows + R**, type:
     ```
     sysdm.cpl
     ```
     and press **Enter**.
   - In the **System Properties** window, go to **Advanced** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**.
   - Under **System variables**, find and select **Path**, then click **Edit**.
   - Click **New** and add the path to FFmpeg‚Äôs `bin` folder, e.g.:
     ```
     C:\ffmpeg\bin
     ```
   - Click **OK** to close all dialogs.

5. **Verify installation**  
   - Open **Command Prompt** and type:
     ```
     ffmpeg -version
     ```
     You should see the version info, confirming FFmpeg is installed and accessible from anywhere.

---

### 2. Installing the Application

1. Go to the **Releases** page.
2. Download the latest archive for your system:
    * **macOS/Linux**: Download the `.tar.gz` file (`..._MacOS_arm64.tar.gz` for Apple Silicon, `..._MacOS_x86_64.tar.gz` for Intel, or `..._Linux.tar.gz` for Linux).
    * **Windows**: Download the `.zip` or `.tar.gz` file.
3. **Extract the archive**:
    * On macOS and Linux, double-click the `.tar.gz` file to extract the application, or use:
      ```bash
      tar -xzf Podcast_Generator_MacOS_arm64.tar.gz
      ```
    * On Windows, unzip the archive.
4. **Move the application**:
    * On macOS, drag `Podcast Generator.app` to your `Applications` folder.
    * On Windows, place the extracted folder anywhere you like.
    * On Linux, place it in your home directory or any preferred location.

---

### üí° Note for macOS Users

When you first run the application, macOS will show several security warnings because it's not from the App Store. This is normal.

1. **"App downloaded from the internet"**: Click **Open**.
2. **"Unidentified Developer"**: macOS may block the app. Click **OK**, then:
    * Go to **System Settings** ‚Üí **Privacy & Security**.
    * Scroll to the **Security** section.
    * Click **Open Anyway** and confirm.

---

### üí° Note for Windows Users (Windows 10 / 11)

When you first run the application, **Windows SmartScreen** might block it because it‚Äôs not signed by Microsoft Store.

1. When you double-click the executable, you might see a window saying:  
   *"Windows protected your PC"*.

2. Click on **More info**.

3. Then click on **Run anyway**.

After doing this once, Windows will remember your choice and won‚Äôt show the warning again.

---

### First Launch: API Key

On first launch, the application will request your **ElevenLabs API key** (and optionally your **Google Gemini API key**).  
It will be stored securely.

---

## üöÄ Advanced Feature: HTML Demo Generation (optional)
 
 The app can generate a shareable HTML page with your podcast audio and a synchronized, word-by-word highlighted transcript. This is perfect for sharing demos or for accessibility.
 
 See an example of a generated HTML page [here](https://laurentftech.github.io/Podcast_generator/assets/who_am_i.html).
 
 ### Installing Optional Dependencies for Demo Generation
 
 This feature relies on `whisperx` for audio alignment, which requires PyTorch. These are heavy dependencies, so they are optional. To enable this feature, you need to install them manually.
 
 **1. Install PyTorch**  
 It is highly recommended to install the CPU-only version of PyTorch, as it is much lighter and sufficient for this application. Visit the official PyTorch website and select the appropriate options for your system.
 
 For example, using `conda`:

```bash
conda install pytorch torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```

 **2. Install WhisperX**  
Once PyTorch is installed, you can install whisperx and its other dependencies using the [demo] extra:
pip install .[demo]

```bash
pip install .[demo]
```
