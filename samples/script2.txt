Samantha: <amused> Queen Elizabeth II !!!
John: <smiling> Correct, Samantha! Your turn now — describe someone for me to guess.
Samantha: <thinking> Alright… Who am I? I’m a famous scientist. I was born in Germany, but I later moved to the USA. My hair was wild and white, and I often stuck my tongue out in photos. I developed the theory of relativity. Who am I?
John: <grinning> Easy one! You’re Albert Einstein!
Samantha: <laughing> Correct! Okay, your turn again.
John: <playful> Who am I? I wear a red suit and a big black belt. I have a long white beard. I bring presents to children around the world on Christmas Eve. I ride a sleigh pulled by reindeer. Who am I?
Samantha: <excited> Santa Claus! 🎅
John: <cheerful> Exactly!
