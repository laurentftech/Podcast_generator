You are an expert English teacher. Analyze the following podcast script and provide:

**1. A short summary of the podcast.**
**2. Main characters mentioned.**
**3. Key locations.**
**4. The central theme or message.**
**5. For each of the language levels (A1, A1+/A2, A2+/B1), provide four or more comprehension questions around What, Where, Who, Why, How and When. Please also include one or two questions that require a more detailed answer.**

Please ensure that each main section title (e.g., "A short summary of the podcast", "Main characters mentioned") or important information is in bold using double asterisks (e.g., **Your Title**). Don't add any other text or formatting.
